# Vimfiles
After many years using Vim and having to configurate all plugins over and over again every time that I decide to change my OS. I decided to organize and my vimfiles available. I haven't to many plugins and cofigurations done now (because I'm gonna update as needed). No pain anymore :sweat:.

I've created a repository (also forked from a good idea) to config my machine called [pedrocesar-ti/machine](https://github.com/pedrocesar-ti/machine), and there I guarantee the installation of all tools needed and copy vimfiles installation, even if you are in a MacOSX or a Debian bassed Linux.

##Installing
```console
$ wget https://github.com/pedrocesar-ti/Vimfiles/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd Vimfiles-master/
$ ./setup.sh
```

Enjoy! :)
