# my-alexa-skills
I would like to share with you some skills that I have developed for my [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa), most of them are inspired by the [Alexa Skill Kit](https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js/tree/deprecated), but most of them solve problems in real world for a tech guy, like starting builds in a CI tool or even joke with his girlfriend.

Each skill has it own documentation so check out.
