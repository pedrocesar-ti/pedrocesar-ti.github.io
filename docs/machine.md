# machine

Machine setup, powered by Ansible and forked from [caarlos0/machine](https://github.com/caarlos0/machine).
Ajusted couple things to configurate all needed scenarios on my case.

## Usage:

```console
$ wget https://github.com/pedrocesar-ti/machine/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd machine-master
```

At this point, you might want to edit the `main.yml` file and comment
out stuff you don't want, when you're done, simply run:

```console
$ ./setup.sh
```

Enjoy! :)
