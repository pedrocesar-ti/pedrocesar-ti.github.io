# bash_facilities

This repos is forked from [wesleyit/bash_facilities](https://github.com/wesleyit/bash_facilities) that I liked but I took some things off and create something usefull to me.

Idea
----------
Give you a better management of your bash config and init files. 

Bash is your friend so go ahead and make it your way!


Used by
----------
I've created a repository (also forked from a good idea) to config my machine called [pedrocesar-ti/machine](https://github.com/pedrocesar-ti/machine), and there I guarantee the installation of all tools needed and copy bash_facilities installation, even if you are in a MacOSX or a Debian bassed Linux. 

The general requirements are:
* curl
* git
* bash-completion
* rbenv
* nodeenv

Install
-------
To install, open your terminal (using bash, it will not work on zsh or oh-my-zsh).
Type:
```console
$ wget https://github.com/pedrocesar-ti/bash_facilities/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd bash_facilities-master/
$ ./setup.sh
```

Exit the terminal and open it again. It is done!
Enjoy! :)
